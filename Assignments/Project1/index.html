        Hi, my name is Dylan Rich. I'm a Computer Science and Chinese student at Weber State University. I also graduated from the IT program at Davis Applied Technology College in order to round out 
        my technical experience. I love working with computers on many different levels from physical hardware to software development. I am also a casual musician who loves to perform. I graduated 
        from West High School in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 2013 before attending Arizona State Univeristy in Tempe, Arizona for two and a half years. Currently I have transferred to Weber State 
        University where I continue my education.
