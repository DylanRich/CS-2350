        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
            Hi, my name is Dylan Rich. I'm a Computer Science and Chinese student at Weber State University. I also graduated from the IT program at Davis Applied Technology College in order to round out 
            my technical experience. I love working with computers on many different levels from physical hardware to software development. I am also a casual musician who loves to perform. I graduated 
            from West High School in Salt Lake City, Utah, in 2013 before attending Arizona State Univeristy in Tempe, Arizona for two and a half years. Currently I have transferred to Weber State 
            University where I continue my education.

            One of my most enduring passions that I have continued to follow since I was a child is music. I play several instruments, including guitar, bass guitar, piano, drums, and I am vocally trained
            as well. I have played in several bands and groups throughout my life, though none have been especially recent. Below is a song from the last group I played with in 2013, Indigo 7, titled 
            <i>We Only Eat a Full Breakfast Sometimes</i>, or simply <i>Breakfast</i> for short. I played guitar and sang the lead vocals for this group.

        <h1>School</h1>
        <p>
            This is my first semester at Weber State, after spending time at multiple other institutions I find that I enjoy
            the smaller and more casual atmosphere of Weber State far more than the busy and high pressure environment
            of large state schools like Arizona State University and the University of Utah. Below is a history of my education
            and my current schedule
