        One of my most enduring passions that I have continued to follow since I was a child is music. I play several instruments, including guitar, bass guitar, piano, drums, and I am vocally trained
        as well. I have played in several bands and groups throughout my life, though none have been especially recent. Below is a song from the last group I played with in 2013, Indigo 7, titled 
        <i>We Only Eat a Full Breakfast Sometimes</i>, or simply <i>Breakfast</i> for short. I played guitar and sang the lead vocals for this group.
